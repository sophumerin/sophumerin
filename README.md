### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sophie! I'm currently working on improving my skills while I embark on my current position as a Support Expert especially trained in Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery.

My main self-study focus is archetectural solutions based on Microsoft Azure and in the cloud.

Learning projects will also be replicated here, to document my progress.

Thanks for visiting!
