### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sophie! I'm currently working on improving my skills and building a new future for myself.

At first, I'll be focused on the Python-based curriculum in the Codecademy Computer Science Career Path, but I'm always learning as broadly as I can.

Learning projects will also be replicated here, to document my progress.

Thanks for reading!
